# Token Burn Mechanism

## Project Description
This project implements a **Deflationary Token** that burns a percentage of tokens during each transaction. Every transfer reduces the total supply, ensuring a decreasing token supply over time.

## Smart Contract Details
- **Contract Name**: DeflationaryToken
- **Burn Rate**: 2% per transaction
- **Smart Contract Address**: `0x10E2fcb0F78BB30214626712669d3b6b9b896905`

## Features
- ðŸ”¥ **Automatic Burn**: A portion of tokens is burned on every transfer.
- ðŸ”„ **Decentralized**: No central control over the burn mechanism.
- ðŸ“‰ **Supply Reduction**: Total supply decreases over time, creating scarcity.

## Installation

## Deployment
